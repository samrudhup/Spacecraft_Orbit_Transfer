# Spacecraft_Orbit_Transfer
This project presents an optimal orbit transfer developed for a low-thrust planar transfer from a Low Earth Orbit (LOR) to a Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). The optimal orbit transfer problem is modeled using a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). The problem was solved with an objective to minimize the fuel consumption and to minimize final time. The two point boundary value problem is solved using the shooting method.
