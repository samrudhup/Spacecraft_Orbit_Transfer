# Spacecraft_Orbit_Transfer
This project presents a optimal orbit transfer developed for a low-thrust planar transfer from a Low Earth Orbit (LOR) to a Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). the optimal orbit transfer problem is modeled using a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). In order to minimize the fuel consumption, or what is the same the final time. The two point boundary value problem is solved using the shooting method.
